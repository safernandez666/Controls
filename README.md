# Controls Dockerized

This project is on my **Github**. The only thing that changes is that I have Dockerized it.

## Getting Started ðŸš€ 

### Requirements ðŸ“‹

It is important to have installed Docker.oi & docker-compose.

### Install ðŸ”§

_Clon the Proyect_

```

_Configure the LDAP Server in login.php & add the Group to the AD User_

```
$host = '192.168.0.190';
$domain = 'ironbox.local';
$basedn = 'dc=ironbox,dc=local';
